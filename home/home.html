Voters log in to the secure online voting platform using their credentials. This platform could be a website or a dedicated application.</p>
          <p><b>Reviewing Candidates or Options:</b>

Voters view the list of candidates or options on the digital ballot. They can navigate through the choices and make their selections.</p>
          <p><b>Casting the Vote:</b>

Voters submit their choices electronically. This could involve clicking on candidate names or selecting options on a digital interface.</p>
          <p><b>Confirmation:</b>

          <p><b>Security Measures:</b>

Robust security measures are in place to protect the integrity and confidentiality of the voting process. This includes encryption, firewalls, and other cybersecurity measures.</p>
          <p><b>Vote Tabulation:</b>

The online voting system collects and tabulates the votes. This can be an automated process, and the system ensures that each vote is counted accurately.</p>
          <p><b>Results Declaration:</b>

Once the voting period concludes, election officials or the relevant authorities declare the results based on the aggregated online votes. </p>
